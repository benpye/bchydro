## Disclaimer

This package has been developed without the express permission of BC Hydro. It accesses data by submitting forms that end-users would typically use in a browser. I'd love to work with BC Hydro to find a better way to access this data, perhaps through an official API... if you know anyone that works there, pass this along!
